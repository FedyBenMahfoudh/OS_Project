# 🔧 Linux Process Scheduler Simulation — GitHub Repository Documentation (Linux - C)

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains the full source code and documentation for a **Linux Process Scheduling Simulator** written in **C**. It is intended to be published on GitHub as an open‑source educational project.

This README is written specifically for GitHub users: contributors, instructors, and developers interested in OS scheduling algorithms.
This project implements a **multitasking process scheduling simulator** in the C programming language under Linux. It simulates the behavior of an operating system scheduler using different scheduling algorithms. Processes are described in a configuration file, and the scheduling policies are loaded dynamically at runtime.

The project includes:

* A console-based simulation engine
* Multiple scheduling algorithms (FIFO, Round Robin, Preemptive Priority)
* Dynamic loading of scheduling policies (`dlopen`, `dlsym`)
* Modular code organization
* A Makefile for building and installing the program
